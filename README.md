In this repo there are three microtask questions:

1) Color a span/div element content when a user moves the mouse over the element.
2) Use prompt to read a value from user and display it in the span element.
3) Display the mouse X and Y coordinates in a <span> tag when you click on a <h1> tag which contains a paragraph.
